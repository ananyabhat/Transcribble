# Transcribble
Transcribble is an iOS project I made during the summer of 2017 at Makeschool, which I attended on scholarship. 
The purpose of Transcribble was to help people transcribe voice memos or other audio recordings quickly, easily, and for free.

At the time, I was a student journalist for my high school newsmagazine, El Estoque, and often had to spend hours
transcribing long interviews because I couldn't afford to pay for professional transcription services. Thus, I desired to
make an app that would help student journalists like myself, as well as students with visual or learning disabilities who 
prefer to record lectures and use transcribed lectures to make notes. 

This app was available on the app store for two years
and had 65 downloads, but unfortunately had to be taken down as I could no longer support the volume of recordings uploaded to the app.
